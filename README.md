# Singularity - A Face Recognition Project

![Project Banner or GIF of the app in action]

**Singularity** is a web-based face recognition application built with React. The project leverages deep learning models to perform real-time face detection, landmark detection, and identification from a live video stream or static images.

The name "Singularity" refers to the core concept of the project: treating every individual's facial signature as a unique, singular point of data that can be accurately identified and verified.
